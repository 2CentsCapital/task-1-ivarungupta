### 1) Alpha in the Market
- Research if there is any alpha in the market that has been running profitably for more than 10 years.
- If profitable, analyze the equity curve:
  - How does the equity curve look?
  - Provide insights based on the equity curve.
- If unable to find, research systems that have been working for a long time:
  - What is common in these systems?
  - How do they remain profitable over a long period?
  - How do they work?

### 2) Dataframe Cleaning and Anomaly Detection
- Pick a dataframe and clean it.
- Create a one-pager highlighting:
  - The anomalies detected in the data.
  - Ways in which data can be wrong.
  - Conditions applied for data cleaning.
- Example:
  - If there are NaN values, explain how you're fixing them:
    - Are you forward filling them or interpolating?
    - Why are you using that method? Provide reasoning.

### 3) Risk Metrics Analysis
- Familiarize yourself with all the risk metrics and their applications.
